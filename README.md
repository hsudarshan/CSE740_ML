# CSE740_ML
In this project we used the million songs dataset to predict the songs hotness. We used logistic regression and random forests to build our prediction model. Elastic net was used to extract the important features. Google Cloud platform was used to setup a spark cluster. The spark cluster provided an accuracy of around 70% for song hotness.
